SQL injection is a type of cyber attack that occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate or inject malicious SQL (Structured Query Language) code into an application's database query. This vulnerability arises when an application does not properly validate or sanitize user inputs before including them in SQL statements.

Here's a basic explanation of how SQL injection works:

1. **User Input in SQL Query:**
   - An application takes user input (e.g., from a web form) and constructs a SQL query using that input.

2. **Malicious Input:**
   - An attacker provides specially crafted input that includes SQL code along with the legitimate user input.

3. **Injection Attack:**
   - The malicious SQL code becomes part of the query and gets executed by the database server.

4. **Unauthorized Access or Manipulation:**
   - Depending on the nature of the attack, the attacker may gain unauthorized access to data, manipulate database records, or perform other malicious actions.

Example of a vulnerable SQL query (Java example using JDBC):

```java
String username = userInput; // Assume userInput is directly taken from user input
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "';";
```

In the above example, if the user provides a malicious input like `' OR '1'='1'; --`, the resulting query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'; --';
```

The double hyphen (`--`) is a SQL comment, so the rest of the original query is ignored. The condition `'1'='1'` is always true, effectively bypassing any authentication checks.

To prevent SQL injection, it is crucial to use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by database APIs. Parameterized queries separate user input from the SQL query, making it impossible for attackers to inject malicious code directly.

Example of a secure SQL query (Java example using JDBC with a prepared statement):

```java
String username = userInput; // Assume userInput is directly taken from user input
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?";
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(query);
preparedStatement.setString(1, username);
ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
```

In this secure example, the user input is treated as a parameter and is not directly included in the SQL query, preventing SQL injection attacks.

## Prepared Statement
Using a prepared statement is an effective way to prevent SQL injection attacks. Prepared statements, or parameterized queries, are a feature provided by database APIs that allow you to execute SQL queries with parameters. This separation of SQL code from user input helps to mitigate the risk of SQL injection.


Yes, `PreparedStatement` provides a level of security against SQL injection attacks. SQL injection is a common security vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into an application's SQL statements, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database or manipulating its data.

Here's how `PreparedStatement` work and why they help prevent SQL injection:

1. **Parameterized Queries**
   - In a prepared statement, placeholders (usually represented by question marks `?`) are used for input parameters in the SQL query.
   - The actual values of parameters are set separately from the SQL query.
   - Instead of concatenating user input directly into the SQL string, you set parameters using dedicated methods like `setString()`, `setInt()`, etc.

   Example:
   ```java
   String userInput = "Alice";
   String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?";
   PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
   preparedStatement.setString(1, userInput);
   ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
   ```

2. **Separation of SQL Code and Data:**
   - User input is treated as a parameter and is never directly concatenated into the SQL query.
   - This separation ensures that user input is always treated as data and not as executable code.

3. **Automatic Escaping:**
   - When you use a prepared statement, the database driver automatically handles escaping and quoting of input parameters.
   - This helps prevent SQL injection by ensuring that user input is properly sanitized before being included in the query.

   Example:
   ```java
   String userInput = "Alice'; DROP TABLE users; --";
   String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?";
   PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
   preparedStatement.setString(1, userInput);
   ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
   ```

   In this example, even if the `userInput` contains special characters, they are treated as data, not as executable SQL code.

4. **Compile-Time Checking:**
   - `PreparedStatement` statements are precompiled, and any attempt to execute a query with invalid SQL syntax (due to injection) would result in a SQL syntax error during the compilation phase, not at runtime.

Example of a vulnerable query (using string concatenation):

```java
String userInput = "'; DROP TABLE users; --";
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + userInput + "';";
```

Example of a secure query (using a prepared statement):

```java
String userInput = "'; DROP TABLE users; --";
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?";
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(query);
preparedStatement.setString(1, userInput);
ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
```

In the secure example, the user input is treated as a parameter (`?`) and is set using the `setString` method. The database driver automatically handles the necessary escaping, preventing the injection of malicious SQL code.

By using prepared statements and avoiding string concatenation for constructing SQL queries, you significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities in your application.

## Statement vs Prepared Statement
Both `Statement` and `PreparedStatement` are interfaces provided by the JDBC API for executing SQL statements. However, they differ in terms of their functionality, usage, and performance characteristics.

1. **Statement:**
   - **Functionality:**
     - `Statement` is used for executing simple SQL statements without parameters.
     - SQL queries are directly embedded in the Java code as strings.
   - **Usage:**
     - Suitable for executing static SQL statements that do not change during the program's execution.
     - May be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks if the SQL statement includes user input without proper validation.
   - **Performance:**
     - Generally slower compared to `PreparedStatement` for executing repeated similar queries.

   Example:
   ```java
   Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
   ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM example_table WHERE name = 'Alice'");
   ```

2. **PreparedStatement:**
   - **Functionality:**
     - `PreparedStatement` is used for executing parameterized SQL statements.
     - SQL queries are precompiled with placeholders (`?`) for parameters.
     - Suitable for handling dynamic queries and preventing SQL injection attacks.
   - **Usage:**
     - Suitable for executing queries with user-provided parameters or for executing the same SQL statement multiple times with different parameter values.
   - **Performance:**
     - Generally faster than `Statement`, especially for executing the same query with different parameter values multiple times. The precompilation of the query can lead to performance improvements.

   Example:
   ```java
   PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM example_table WHERE name = ?");
   preparedStatement.setString(1, "Alice");
   ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
   ```

**Key Differences:**
- **Parameterization:** `PreparedStatement` allows parameterized queries, providing a way to set parameters safely without concatenating user input directly into the SQL string.
- **Precompilation:** `PreparedStatement` is precompiled, which can result in better performance for repeated similar queries.
- **SQL Injection:** `PreparedStatement` helps prevent SQL injection attacks by automatically escaping parameters.
- **Readability:** `PreparedStatement` can make the code more readable and maintainable, especially for dynamic queries.

In summary, while both `Statement` and `PreparedStatement` are used for executing SQL statements in JDBC, `PreparedStatement` is preferred for most scenarios due to its advantages in terms of performance, security, and ease of use, especially when dealing with parameterized queries.
