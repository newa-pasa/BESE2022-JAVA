Spring and Spring Boot are both projects within the larger Spring Framework ecosystem, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.

### Spring Framework:

1. **Purpose:**
   - The Spring Framework is a comprehensive framework for building Java-based enterprise applications.
   - It provides support for various concerns such as dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, transaction management, data access, and more.
   - Spring follows the modular design principle, allowing developers to choose the modules they need for their specific application requirements.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Configuration in the Spring Framework is often XML-based, but it also supports Java-based configuration (using annotations and Java classes).
   - Developers need to configure many aspects of the application explicitly.

3. **Boilerplate Code:**
   - Spring Framework projects may require some boilerplate code for configuration and setup.
   - Developers have more control over the configuration details.

### Spring Boot:

1. **Purpose:**
   - Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring Framework that simplifies the process of building production-ready applications.
   - It is designed to be opinionated, providing defaults and conventions to reduce the need for manual configuration.
   - The goal is to enable developers to quickly create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Spring Boot emphasizes convention over configuration.
   - It uses sensible defaults for configuration, and a large part of the configuration is done automatically based on the project's structure and dependencies.
   - Configuration is typically done using properties files (application.properties or application.yml).

3. **Boilerplate Code:**
   - Spring Boot reduces boilerplate code by providing default configurations and sensible defaults.
   - It includes features like embedded servers, auto-configuration, and the ability to create standalone JARs with an embedded web server.

4. **Embedded Servers:**
   - Spring Boot includes embedded servers (such as Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow), allowing developers to run applications as standalone JARs without the need for external server installations.

5. **Spring Boot Starters:**
   - Spring Boot introduces the concept of "starters," which are pre-configured dependencies that simplify the inclusion of common libraries and configurations for specific tasks (e.g., web applications, data access).

### Comparison Summary:

- **Spring Framework** is a comprehensive framework for building enterprise applications with a modular design and extensive configurability.
- **Spring Boot** is an opinionated extension of the Spring Framework that simplifies the development of production-ready applications by providing defaults, conventions, and automated configuration.

| Feature                | Spring Framework                                | Spring Boot                                           |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Comprehensive framework for enterprise apps     | Simplifies building production-ready applications     |
| **Configuration**      | XML-based or Java-based (annotations, classes)  | Primarily property-based (application.properties)      |
| **Convention Over Configuration** | Less emphasis, more explicit configuration   | Strong emphasis on convention over configuration        |
| **Boilerplate Code**   | More boilerplate code for configuration        | Reduced boilerplate with defaults and conventions      |
| **Embedded Servers**   | External server installations commonly used    | Includes embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow)    |
| **Starters**           | Not a concept in Spring Framework              | Starters provide pre-configured dependencies            |
| **Auto-Configuration** | Less automated, more manual configuration      | Automated configuration based on project dependencies |
| **Project Structure**  | More freedom in structuring the project        | Suggested project structure with conventions           |
| **Dependency Injection**| Core feature with XML or annotations           | Core feature with simplified and automated injection  |
| **Learning Curve**     | Steeper learning curve due to flexibility       | Lower learning curve with conventions and defaults     |
| **Use Case**           | Enterprise applications, diverse scenarios    | Rapid development, microservices, opinionated projects |
