ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It is a programming technique used in software development to bridge the gap between the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm and relational databases. ORM allows developers to interact with databases using object-oriented programming languages, such as Java, Python, or C#, without directly dealing with SQL queries.

Key concepts and features of ORM include:

1. **Mapping:**
   - ORM provides a way to map between the objects in the application code and the tables in a relational database. Each class in the application typically corresponds to a table in the database, and instances of the class (objects) correspond to rows in the table.

2. **Abstraction:**
   - ORM abstracts away the details of the underlying database structure and allows developers to work with high-level objects and relationships. This abstraction simplifies database interactions and reduces the need for manual SQL queries.

3. **CRUD Operations:**
   - ORM frameworks automate common database operations known as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Developers can use methods and properties on objects to perform these operations, and the ORM framework translates these operations into the corresponding SQL statements.

4. **Relationships:**
   - ORM supports the modeling of relationships between objects in the application, and these relationships are reflected in the database. For example, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relationships can be defined and maintained through ORM.

5. **Query Language:**
   - ORM frameworks often provide their own query languages or query builders that allow developers to express database queries using a language or syntax that is more closely aligned with the programming language, rather than using raw SQL.

6. **Automatic Schema Generation:**
   - Some ORM frameworks can automatically generate the database schema based on the object model defined in the application code. This can simplify the database setup process.

7. **Portability:**
   - ORM can increase the portability of code by allowing developers to switch between different database systems without rewriting the entire data access layer. The ORM framework handles the database-specific details.

8. **Caching and Performance Optimization:**
   - ORM frameworks often include features such as caching and performance optimizations to improve the efficiency of database operations.

Popular ORM frameworks in various programming languages include:

- Java: Hibernate, EclipseLink, MyBatis
- Python: SQLAlchemy, Django ORM
- .NET: Entity Framework (EF), NHibernate

### Pros- Object-Relational Data Model

The following are some of the benefits of the Object-Relational model:
1. **Inheritance:** Users of this data model can inherit objects, tables, and other data to expand their capability. Inherited objects have new properties in addition to those that were inherited.
2. **Complex Data Types:** Existing data types can be used to create complex data types. This is useful in the Object-Relational data model because complex data types allow for more effective data manipulation.
3. **Extensibility:** In the Object-Relational data model, the systemâ€™s capability can be expanded. This can be accomplished through the use of complicated data types and advanced Object-Oriented concepts such as inheritance.
### Cons- Object-Relational Data Model
1. Because it combines the features of both the Object-Oriented data model and the Relational data model, this data model can be rather complicated and hard to handle at times.
